  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Ajiaco is a unique Colombian dish, especially beloved in the city of Bogota. It's a hearty chicken soup made with potatoes and corn on the cob. If you can find them, use small yellow Andean potatoes called papas criollasâ€”they dissolve and thicken the soup as it cooks. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts </li>
    <li>1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>5 clove garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock </li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds mixed potatoes (such as red, Yukon Gold, and russets), peeled and cut into bite-size chunks</li>
    <li>2 to 3 medium ears corn, quartered, or 1 1/2 cups frozen corn kernels</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, tied with kitchen twine</li>
    <li>1 bunch green onions, tied with kitchen twine</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dried guascas </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
    <li>Place the chicken in a glass or ceramic dish. Top with the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a heavy 4-quart lidded pot over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken with the vegetables and brown each side, about 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour in the stock and raise the heat to high.</li>
    <li>When the mixture boils, lower the heat to medium-low then cover and simmer. Cook until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the chicken to a platter, reserving the cooking liquid in the pot.</li>
    <li>When cool enough to handle, remove the skin from the chicken and discard. Cut or tear the chicken breasts into bite-size strips and discard the bones.</li>
    <li>Place the potatoes in the pot with the cooking liquid and turn the heat to medium. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the corn, cilantro, green onions, and the guascas. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender, but not overcooked.</li>
    <li>Remove the cilantro and green onions and return the chicken to the pot. Simmer a few minutes more until the chicken is warmed through.</li>
    <li>Ladle the soup into individual bowls and place the toppings on the table to be passed around.</li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
